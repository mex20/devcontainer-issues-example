*Previous workflow:* 
- Install ``` VS Code ``` and ``` Docker Desktop ```. Make sure Docker is running.
- Install the ``` Dev Containers ``` and ``` Docker ``` extensions for ``` VS Code```.
- Clone this repository with ```VS Code ```, but do not run the command ``` npm install ``` before the ``` VS Code ``` ``` dev container ``` for this repository is launched. Otherwise you are going to have a bad time.
- Open this repository in ``` VS Code ```
- Click on the Green button in the bottom left corner of ``` VS Code ``` after opening this repository's folder. Select the ```Open Folder in Container``` option. Then you will choose the ``` sanghelios ``` folder to start the ``` Azure-Remix-Stack ``` app. The ``` balaho ``` container will start automatically in the background, or if you want to work on the ``` balaho ``` python app, open a ``` new window ``` in ``` VS Code ``` then start this step over and choose the ``` balaho ``` folder instead of the ``` sanghelios ``` folder. ![210502108-19d1fdaf-7d2a-41a9-b66e-99b3583d64f2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12109514/231273279-498a4b38-1696-4dc4-9ea3-8bdd8657c842.png)
- Wait for the ``` VS Code ``` containers to build.
